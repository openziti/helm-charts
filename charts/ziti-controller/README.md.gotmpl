## Overview

This chart runs a Ziti controller in Kubernetes. It uses the custom resources provided by [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) and [trust-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/projects/trust-manager/#installation), i.e., Issuer, Certificate, and Bundle.

The client API must be published with a TLS passthrough Ingress, NodePort, or LoadBalancer. The ctrl plane and management API share the client API's TLS listener, so they're reached through the same address by default.

## Setup

### Add the OpenZiti Charts Repo to Helm

```bash
helm repo add openziti https://docs.openziti.io/helm-charts/
```

### Install Required Custom Resource Definitions

This chart requires declaring the Certificate, Issuer, and Bundle custom resource APIs before installation.

```bash
kubectl apply \
    --filename https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.crds.yaml
helm template trust-manager jetstack/trust-manager \
    --version v0.16.0 --set crds.keep=false --show-only templates/crd-trust.cert-manager.io_bundles.yaml \
| yq 'del(.metadata.labels."app.kubernetes.io/managed-by") | del(.metadata.labels."helm.sh/chart")' \
| kubectl apply --filename -
```

## Optional Sub-Charts

Ziti Controller requires Cert Manager and Trust Manager operators running in the cluster. You may use existing deployments of either or install either or both as sub-charts by setting additional input values on the command line.

```bash
--set cert-manager-enabled="true" --set trust-manager-enabled="true"
```

Or, as YAML:

```yaml
cert-manager-enabled: true
trust-manager-enabled: true
```

## Minimal Installation

This first example shows a minimal installation for a Kubernetes distribution that provides TLS pass-through for Service type LoadBalancer, e.g., k3s, k3d, Minikube. This is useful for environments where there's no cost, or justifiable cost, associated with provisioning a LoadBalancer with TLS passthrough.

You must supply one value when you install the chart.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
|clientApi.advertisedHost|string|nil|the DNS name that edge clients and routers will resolve to reach this controller's edge client API|
|clientApi.advertisedPort|string|nil|the TCP port associated with the advertisedHost to advertise to edge clients and routers|

```bash
helm install \
    --namespace ziti-controller ziti-controller-minimal1 \
    openziti/ziti-controller \
        --set clientApi.advertisedHost="ziti-controller-minimal.example.com" \
        --set clientApi.advertisedPort="443"
```

A default admin user and password will be generated and saved to a secret during installation. The credentials can be retrieved using this command:

<!-- {% raw %} "raw" escapes this code block's handlebars from GH Pages Jekyll, and {{``}} escapes the Go template from helm-docs -->
```bash
kubectl get secret \
    -n ziti-controller ziti-controller-minimal1-admin-secret \
    -o go-template='{{`{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{printf "%s: " $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v | base64decode}}{{end}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}`}}'
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

Visit the Ziti Administration Console (ZAC): https://ziti-controller-minimal.example.com/zac/

You may log in the `ziti` CLI with one command or omit the `-p` part to prompt:

<!-- {% raw %} "raw" escapes this code block's handlebars from GH Pages Jekyll, and {{``}} escapes the Go template from helm-docs -->
```bash
ziti edge login ziti-controller-minimal.example.com:1280 \
    --yes \
    --username admin \
    --password $(
        kubectl -n ziti-controller \
            get secrets ziti-controller-minimal1-admin-secret \
                -o go-template='{{`{{index .data "admin-password" | base64decode }}`}}'
        )
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

## Using ClusterIP Services with an Ingress Controller

The default K8s service type for this chart is `ClusterIP`. You can publish these cluster-internal services with an `Ingress` resource. You need an Ingress Controller. Here's an example of using [the community `ingress-nginx` chart](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installing-nic/installation-with-helm/) to provision ingresses for the controller's `ClusterIP` services.

Ensure you have the `ingress-nginx` chart installed with `controller.extraArgs.enable-ssl-passthrough=true`. You can verify this feature is enabled by running `kubectl describe pods {ingress-nginx-controller pod}` and checking the args for `--enable-ssl-passthrough=true`.

If necessary, patch the `ingress-nginx` deployment to enable TLS passthrough.

```bash
kubectl patch deployment "ingress-nginx-controller" \
    --namespace ingress-nginx \
    --type json \
    --patch '[{"op": "add",
        "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-",
        "value":"--enable-ssl-passthrough"
    }]'
```

Create a Helm chart values file like this.

```yaml
# /tmp/controller-values.yml
clientApi:
    advertisedHost: ziti-controller-managed.example.com
    advertisedPort: 443
    service:
        type: ClusterIP
    ingress:
        enabled: true
        ingressClassName: nginx
        annotations:
            kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http: "false"
            nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: "true"
```

Now install or upgrade this controller chart with your values file.

```bash
helm install \
    --namespace ziti-controller ziti-controller-managed1 \
    openziti/ziti-controller \
    --values /tmp/controller-values.yml
```

### Expose the Router Control Plane

This is applicable if you have any routers outside the Ziti controller's cluster. You must configure pass-through TLS LoadBalancer or Ingress for the control plane service. Routers running in the same cluster as the controller can use the cluster service named `{controller release}-ctrl` (the "ctrl" endpoint). This example demonstrates a pass-through Ingress resource for `nginx-ingress`.

Merge this with your Helm chart values file before installing or upgrading.

```yaml
ctrlPlane:
    advertisedHost: ziti-controller-managed-ctrl.example.com
    advertisedPort: 443
    service:
        enabled: true
    ingress:
        enabled: true
        ingressClassName: nginx
        annotations:
            kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http: "false"
            nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: "true"
```

## Extra Security for the Management API

You can split the client and management APIs into separate cluster services by setting `managementApi.service.enabled=true`. With this configuration, you'll have an additional cluster service named `{release}-mgmt` that is the management API, and the client API will not have management features.

This Helm chart's values allow for both operational scenarios: combined and split. The default choice is to expose the combined client and management APIs as the cluster service named `{release}-client`, which is convenient because you can use the `ziti` CLI immediately. For additional security, you may shelter the management API by splitting these two sets of features, exposing them as separate API servers. After the split, you can access the management API in several ways:

* deploy a tunneler to bind a Ziti service targeting `{release}-mgmt.{namespace}.svc:{port}`.
* `kubectl -n {namespace} port-forward deployments/{release}-mgmt 8443:{port}`

The web console (ZAC) is always bound to the same web listener as the management API, so you can access it at that `/zac/` path on the same URL.

## Advanced PKI

The default configuration generates a singular PKI root of trust for all the controller's servers and the edge signer CA. Optionally, you may provide the name of a cert-manager Issuer or ClusterIssuer to become the root of trust for the Ziti controller's identity.

Merge this with your Helm chart values file before installing or upgrading.

```yaml
ctrlPlane:
    issuer:
        kind: ClusterIssuer
        name: my-alternative-cluster-issuer
```

You may also configure the Ziti controller to use separate PKI roots of trust for its three main identities: control plane, edge signer, and web bindings.

For example, to use a separate CA for the edge signer function, merge this with your Helm chart values file before installing or upgrading.

```yaml
edgeSignerPki:
    enabled: true
```

## Prometheus Monitoring

This chart provides a default disabled `ziti-controller-prometheus` k8s service for prometheus,
which can be enabled with `prometheus.service.enabled`. Enabling it will create a prometheus ServiceMonitor
for configuring the prometheus endpoint. It is also important that you enable
`fabric.events.enabled` for getting a full set of metrics.

For more information, please check [here](https://openziti.io/docs/learn/core-concepts/metrics/prometheus/).

## Values Reference

{{ template "chart.valuesTable" . }}

## TODO's

* replicas - Each controller replica needs to be it's own HA member. We have to wait until HA https://github.com/openziti/ziti/blob/release-next/doc/ha/overview.md is officially released.
* lower CA / Cert lifetime; how to refresh stuff when Certs are updated?
* Deploy Prometheus scraper configuration when `prometheus.enabled = true`

## Alternative Web Server Certificates

The purpose of the alt_server_certs feature is to bind a publicly trusted server certificate to the controller's web listener. This is useful for publishing the controller's client API with a different DNS name for BrowZer and console clients that must verify the controller's identity with their OS trusted root store.

### Request an alternative server certificate from a cert-manager issuer

The most automatic way to bind an alt cert is the certManager mode provided by this chart. This example implies you have separately created a cert-manager ClusterIssuer named "cloudflare-dns01-issuer" that is able to obtain a certificate for the specified DNS name. If publishing the client API's alternative DNS name as a separate Ingress, you may reference that advertised host when requesting the alternative server certificate as shown here with an inline template to ensure they match. 

<!-- {% raw %} "raw" escapes this code block's handlebars from GH Pages Jekyll, and {{``}} escapes the Go template from helm-docs -->
```yaml
clientApi:
    advertisedHost: edge.ziti.example.com
    ingress:
        enabled: true
        ingressClassName: nginx
        annotations:
            kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http: "false"
            nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: "true"
    service:
        enabled: true
        type: ClusterIP
    altIngress:
        enabled: true
        ingressClassName: nginx
        advertisedHost: alt-edge.ziti.example.com  # this must be different from clientApi.advertisedHost and must match one of the dnsNames in the altServerCert
        annotations:
            kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http: "false"
            nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: "true"

webBindingPki:
    enabled: true
    altServerCerts:
        - mode: certManager
            secretName: my-alt-server-cert
            dnsNames:
                - "{{`{{ .Values.clientApi.altIngress.advertisedHost }}`}}"
            issuerRef:
                group: cert-manager.io
                kind: ClusterIssuer
                name: cloudflare-dns01-issuer
            mountPath: /etc/ziti/alt-server-cert
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->

### Use an alternative certificate and key from a tls secret

The alternative server certificate and key may also be provided from a Kubernetes TLS secret. Declare the tls secret in the additionalVolumes section and reference it in the altServerCerts section.

<!-- {% raw %} "raw" escapes this code block's handlebars from GH Pages Jekyll, and {{``}} escapes the Go template from helm-docs -->
```yaml
additionalVolumes:
    - name: my-alt-server-cert
      volumeType: secret
      mountPath: /etc/ziti/my-alt-server-cert
      secretName: my-alt-server-cert

webBindingPki:
    altServerCerts:
        - mode: secret
          secretName: my-alt-server-cert
```
<!-- {% endraw %} -->
